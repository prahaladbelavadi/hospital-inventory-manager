# Covid Hospital Inventory Management system

## What does the app do
 Allow for hospitals, government and volunteers to interface between inventory status.

### What is inventory

Beds, Beds with Ventilators, PPE;
Hospitals have an inventory record of daily requirements such as needles and syringes. This platform is to record inventory that's likely to be scarce and of utilitarian value to people that need help.

## Why 
Hospitals keep record of inventory using various software that is either custom built or white labelled. This information is siloed within the hospital individually.
  In times, like the covid crisis, there is no visibility into the availability and resource allocated at large. Manually Enquiring and finding out takes a lot of precious time away. 
  In a situation, where a person is in an ambulance, dying, shaving minutes off is critial.
This is ideally meant to help reduce friction in acquisition of relevant high stake information.
In all positive essence, it is better to have the ability/possibility to roll this out rather than to not have something, at time of need.
